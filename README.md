Checks PSN network and tells whether each service is up or down.\
Quickly created during recent outage, so haven't tested when service is up, the status page may not report if service is degraded or not.\
Works for now, may update later, probably won't though\

Updated after long outage and found it was indeed broken! The status is empty if everything is up and running. \
If the status is not empty will show what is down, and also a way to check a specific country for running services.
